This is my second blog post on my _new_ blog

### Javascript

I really enjoy working with javascript. I work as a front end dev building a project with nextjs, typescript, graphQL, apollo, zustand, among other tech.

#### Here's a table

| Hello | Hi     |

I'm building this blog with [Deno](https://deno.land/) and [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) and deploying using [Deno Deploy](https://dash.deno.com/). This blog post is written in markdown.

Deno is nice because it has a lot of built in tools like formatting, testing, permissions, etc.

There's also a really nice [standard library](https://deno.land/std@0.152.0) that is well maintained.
